# EV Population Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) population dataset to identify trends, adoption rates, and other key insights. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and a standalone Python script.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains information on the EV population, including make, model, battery capacity, location, and more.

## 🔧 Installation
To run this project, you need to install Python and Jupyter Notebook. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ev-population-analysis.git
   cd ev-population-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn notebook
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `EV Population.ipynb` file and run the cells.

## 🚀 Running the Python Script
For quick analysis, run the standalone Python script:

```bash
python ev_analysis.py
```

This will generate visualizations and save a processed dataset (`processed_ev_population.csv`).
